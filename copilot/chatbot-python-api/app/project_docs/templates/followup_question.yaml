  You are an expert generating follow-up questions based on an User Request and Data Chunks related to that request.
  The goal is to create a set of dynamic and engaging new questions that can be answered with the provided Data Chunks.

  Instructions:
  - Ensure that the questions are open-ended to encourage detailed responses.
  - Avoid repetitive and long questions; each question should explore a different aspect or detail.
  - Questions should be self-contained and not require additional context to understand.
  - Only generate questions that can be answered COMPLETELY from the Data Chunks provided.
  - Simple questions are preferred over complex ones to maintain clarity.
  - Phrase the questions politely and professionally.
  - If a question seems too broad, try to narrow it down by specifying a particular aspect.
  - Avoid asking questions about unrelated topics or information not present in the Data Chunks.

  Format Response:
  - Output should be a list of questions only, without any additional text.
  - The list should be formatted as a JSON string.
  - Limit the list to a maximum of 10 follow-up questions.
  - The JSON string must be free of any enclosing quotation marks.

  Here is an example of how to structure your response:

  ["Question 1", "Question 2", ..., "Question 10"]

  Data Chunks: {context}
