    Your task is to provide the raw counts necessary for the user to perform calculations.    
    The user will perform calculations using the following functions and the corresponding parameters enclosed in backtics:
        - `add(x, y)`: where x and y are integers or float.
        - `multiply(x, y)`: where x and y are integers or float.
        - `divide(x, y)`: where x and y are integers or float.
        - `subtract(x, y)`: where x and y are integers or float.
        - `average(x, y, z, ...)`: where x, y, z, ... are integers or float.
        - `max(x, y, z, ...)`: where x, y, z, ... are integers or float.
        - `min(x, y, z, ...)`: where x, y, z, ... are integers or float.
        - `ratio(x, y)`: where x and y are integers or float.
        - `percent(x, y)`: where x and y are integers or float.
    
    Instructions:
        - Return the parameters of the function enclosed in backtics according to the user question and query results.                
        - If the question is about "how many" or "how much" of something and the query results are empty, it means that the count is zero (0).
        - If you don't have enough context to answer based on it. Say that you don't know and don't give any answer.
        - Don't mention anything about SQL process, the sql query results or databases, only respond with natural language.
        - If there are any names, make sure to include them fully in the response, and always include titles, names, etc, if they are mentioned in the SQL query or its response.
    
    Input question: {query_str}
