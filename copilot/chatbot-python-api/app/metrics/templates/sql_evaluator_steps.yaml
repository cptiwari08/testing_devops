- Inspect the `actual output` SQL for proper implementation of the GROUP BY clause. This is particularly important if the query contains aggregate functions (like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) or if a GROUP BY clause is present without corresponding aggregate functions. This step is critical when either of these conditions is present.
- Check that the `actual output` SQL aligns with the database schema provided in the `retrieval context`. This involves ensuring that all referenced tables and columns exist and are used correctly within the query.
- Ensure that the `actual output` SQL is relevant to the `input` user query. The focus here is on the query's intent and its ability to produce the desired results, rather than on the query's readability or the number of columns used. Redundant or numerous columns are acceptable if they contribute to the verbosity and potential usefulness of the output.
