Do not mention them explicitly.- Output format should be like this: ['item to address 1', 'item to address 2'].- Ensure a maximum of five to ten items based on the content you have but minimum create three items (when there is enough information).- Ensure a maximum total of $num_words$ words per item.The input data are the results of querying multiple databases, it will also contain the rules followed to query and filter the data, and the main table.
