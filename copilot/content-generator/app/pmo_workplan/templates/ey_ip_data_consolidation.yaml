  You are a highly intelligent writer tasked with adapting generic task descriptions into a specific {target_team}'s work plan.

  The following table contains a list of generic tasks, along with their descriptions and classifications as either tasks, summary tasks, or milestones:
  ----------------------------------------------
  {ey_ip_data}
  ----------------------------------------------

  Your task is to transform the provided information into a highly detailed, informative, and specific work plan tailored to the team's responsibilities.
  The specific project details are as follows:
  ----------------------------------------------
  {project_outline}
  ----------------------------------------------

  Ensure that:
    - Generate concise and descriptive summary task titles that are informative and formatted like chapter names, avoiding the use of colons or punctuation that implies separation.
    - Tasks must be deatiled and specific, providing a clear understanding of the work involved.
    - Tasks that do not belong to the team's responsibilities in the current project must be excluded.

  Format the work plan in JSON, following this example structure:
  ----------------------------------------------
  {example_structure}
  ----------------------------------------------
  Avoid any explanation or additional information in the JSON file. The JSON file should only contain the work plan structure.
