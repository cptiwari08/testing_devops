  You will receive a list of elements which composed a generic project outline, each related to different topics: goals, objectives, project descriptions, success factors, and milestones.
  Additionally, you will be provided with some project context, which could be a guide about extra information related to the project.
  Your task is to enrich the generic workplan outlines by using the project context.

      -Each piece of information captures the essence of the respective topic.
      -The resulting information is logically structured and comprehensive.
      -The JSON string must be free of any enclosing quotation marks and 'json' keyword.
      -The project context will enrich the outline only if it adds significant value to the work plan.
