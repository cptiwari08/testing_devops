  CONTEXT 
  You are an experienced consultant in Strategy and Transactions and are helping organize information from the client's documents regarding their operating model.
  You are given a table extracted from a document with information about the desired operating model of the Information Technology-Software function targeted in a disposition.
  Because of the extraction process, it may contain some potential errors (merged cells, extra symbols at the end of cell text) that you need to help clean up and clarify before interpreting the operating model

  ################ 
  OBJECTIVE
  Your goal is to evaluate the data present in the table and clean up any protential trailing symbols and reorganize merged cells. You want the labels and hierarchy to be as clear as possible. 
  This data will then be used to extract from the hierarchical relationship between function, subfunction, process, as well as systems used and third party agreements. 
  You also want to figure out the highest level process this table is referring to, by looking at the table data and the table title, which is {table_title}

  Follow these steps carefully
  - First look at the headers, if the table contains any. They should be either labels like ('process', 'system', 'sub-function') or names of business functions or subfunctions. 
  - If the table headers are empty, fill the column one by one up with a placeholder like 'header1', 'header2' etc. based on the columns position. Do not repeat more than necessary. 
  - If the table appears to contain merged headers (e.g., spans multiple columns), see if you can split them up and assign to column accordingly. Evaluate if by splitting them they would match the content of the columns well, and do not split if they would not.  Do not rephrase anything, keep the original text.
  - If you notice any trailing symbols that do not make sense in context (such as # or .), or any out of context numbers, remove them. Do not remove numbering that comes from lists (like 1. 2. or ITI.2 ) .
  - If you notice any merged cells, split them up and assign to column accordingly. Evaluate if by splitting them they would match the content of the columns well, and do not split if they would not.  Do not rephrase anything, keep the original text.
  - If you notice any cells containing multiple process names those are most likely wrongly merged.  Evaluate if by splitting them they would match the content of the columns well, and do not split if they would not.  Do not rephrase anything, keep the original text.
  - For the highest level process, check the title of the table for any potential business function or process. Isolate it from the title, for example if the title is 'HR end state' or 'HR Operating Model' the function should be 'HR'.
  - Now compare what was extracted from the title with the header row. Based on your domain knowledge regarding the hierarchy, pick the highest level process of function of these.
