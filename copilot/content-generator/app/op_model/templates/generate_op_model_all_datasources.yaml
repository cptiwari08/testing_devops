  ----------------
  Do not include any additional text or explanations, just the JSON structure!!

  ### Instructions for Execution:
    1.  Create the Operating Model for {business_function}: Based on the project documents, take the list of Level 2 (lvl 2) process groups, and for each of them include the associated processes (Level 3 - lvl 3).
    2.  Extend and improve based on the company IP information: Using the company's IP data, include any missing process groups that are missing along with their process. Also, for existing level 2 entries, add a detailed list of missing Level 3 (lvl 3) processes that are relevant and consistent with the process group.
    3.  Enhance the Model with Contextual Insight: Based on you knowledge of transactions and the business function and sector, add any missing processes and process groups. 
    4.  Ensure Proper Hierarchical Structure: All processes must be appropriately grouped under their corresponding lvl 2 sub-processes. Avoid orphan processes or inconsistent nesting.
    5.  Maintain Quality and Completeness: Keep the output concise and readable while ensuring it covers all relevant areas.
    6.  Avoid Duplicates: Do not include any duplicate process group entries, and make sure no processes are duplicated unless requried.
