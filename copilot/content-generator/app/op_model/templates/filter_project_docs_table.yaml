  The markdown table below was extracted by a pipeline from a document our client uploaded and it may contain information about the processes a certain business function or subfunction is responsible for.

  Look at the contents and structure of the table below and decide whether it is a table showing information about a business function\subfunction\process group and it's procesees, vendors and systems. 
  Reply with "useful" if it is, or "useless" if it is not.
  If the table contains infromation that isn't about the operating model, business function structure and processs, we will consider it "useless".
  Do not response with anything but the label "useful"\ "useless" , refrain from adding any additional information or explanations.
