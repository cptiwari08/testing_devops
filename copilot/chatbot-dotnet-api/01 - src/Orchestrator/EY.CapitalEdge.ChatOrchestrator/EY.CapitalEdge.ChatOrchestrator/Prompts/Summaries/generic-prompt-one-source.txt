    Question: ""How to configure TSA stages?""
        
    Source:  
    '''To configure TSA stages, one must access the configuration settings. These settings include various options such as functions, service locations, TSA statuses,
    sub-functions, currency, service cadences, legal entity, attributes, and default mark-ups. It should be kept in mind that although the TSA Project Manager role can view configuration settings,
    they cannot make changes. Configuring TSA stages typically involves defining the different stages or phases of the TSA process, such as planning, execution, monitoring, and closure.
    Each stage may have specific tasks, deliverables, and timelines associated with it. It is important to align the stages with the objectives and requirements of the TSA agreement.'''
